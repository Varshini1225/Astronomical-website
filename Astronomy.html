<li><ul>Astrophotography, also known as astronomical imaging, is the photography 
or imaging of astronomical objects, celestial events, or areas of the night sky. The first 
photograph of an astronomical object (the Moon) was taken in 1840, but it was not until 
the late 19th century that advances in technology allowed for detailed stellar 
photography. Besides being able to record the details of extended objects such as the 
Moon, Sun, and planets, modern astrophotography has the ability to image objects invisible 
to the human eye such as dim stars, nebulae, and galaxies. This is done by long time 
exposure since both film and digital cameras can accumulate and sum photons over these 
long periods of time.Photography using extended exposure-times revolutionized the field of 
professional astronomical research, recording hundreds of thousands of new stars, and 
nebulae invisible to the human eye. Specialized and ever-larger optical telescopes were 
constructed as essentially big cameras to record images on photographic plates. 
Astrophotography had an early role in sky surveys and star classification but over time it 
has given way to more sophisticated equipment and techniques designed for specific fields 
of scientific research, with image sensors becoming just one of many forms of 
sensor</ul></li>

<ul>The development of astrophotography as a scientific tool was pioneered in 
the mid-19th century for the most part by experimenters and amateur astronomers, or socalled "gentleman scientists" (although, as in other scientific fields, these were not 
always men). Because of the very long exposures needed to capture relatively faint 
astronomical objects, many technological problems had to be overcome. These included 
making telescopes rigid enough so they would not sag out of focus during the exposure, 
building clock drives that could rotate the telescope mount at a constant rate, and 
developing ways to accurately keep a telescope aimed at a fixed point over a long period 
of time. Early photographic processes also had limitations. The daguerreotype process was 
far too slow to record anything but the brightest objects, and the wet plate collodion 
process limited exposures to the time the plate could stay wet.</br>
The earliest surviving dagerrotype of the Moon by Draper (1840)</br>
The first known attempt at astronomical photography was by Louis Jacques 
Mandé Daguerre, inventor of the daguerreotype process which bears his name, who attempted 
in 1839 to photograph the Moon. Tracking errors in guiding the telescope during the long 
exposure meant the photograph came out as an indistinct fuzzy spot. John William Draper, 
New York University Professor of Chemistry, physician and scientific experimenter managed 
to make the first successful photograph of the moon a year later on March 23, 1840, taking 
a 20-minute-long daguerreotype image using a 5-inch (13 cm) reflecting telescope.</br>
The Sun may have been first photographed in an 1845 daguerreotype by the 
French physicists Léon Foucault and Hippolyte Fizeau. A failed attempt to obtain a 
photograph of a Total Eclipse of the Sun was made by the Italian physicist, Gian 
Alessandro Majocchi during an eclipse of the Sun that took place in his home city of 
Milan, on July 8, 1842. He later gave an account of his attempt and the Daguerreotype 
photographs he obtained, in which he wrote:</br>
A few minutes before and after totality an iodized plate was exposed in a 
camera to the light of the thin crescent, and a distinct image was obtained, but another 
plate exposed to the light of the corona for two minutes during totality did not show the 
slightest trace of photographic action. No photographic alteration was caused by the light 
of the corona condensed by a lens for two minutes, during totality, on a sheet of paper 
prepared with bromide of silver.</br>

The first solar eclipse photograph was taken on July 28, 1851, by a 
daguerrotypist named Berkowski.</br>
The Sun's solar corona was first successfully imaged during the Solar 
eclipse of July 28, 1851. Dr. August Ludwig Busch, the Director of the Königsberg 
Observatory gave instructions for a local daguerreotypist named Johann Julius Friedrich 
Berkowski to image the eclipse. Busch himself was not present at Königsberg (now 
Kaliningrad, Russia), but preferred to observe the eclipse from nearby Rixhoft. The 
telescope used by Berkowski was attached to 6+1⁄2-inch (17 cm) Königsberg heliometer and 
had an aperture of only 2.4 in (6.1 cm), and a focal length of 32 in (81 cm). Commencing 
immediately after the beginning of totality, Berkowski exposed a daguerreotype plate for 
84 seconds in the focus of the telescope, and on developing an image of the corona was 
obtained. He also exposed a second plate for about 40 to 45 seconds but was spoiled when 
the sun broke out from behind the moon. More detailed photographic studies of the Sun were 
made by the British astronomer Warren De la Rue starting in 1861.</br>
The first photograph of a star was a daguerreotype of the star Vega by 
astronomer William Cranch Bond and daguerreotype photographer and experimenter John Adams 
Whipple, on July 16 and 17, 1850 with Harvard College Observatory's 15 inch Great 
refractor.In 1863 the English chemist William Allen Miller and English amateur astronomer 
Sir William Huggins used the wet collodion plate process to obtain the first ever 
photographic spectrogram of a star, Sirius and Capella. In 1872 American physician Henry 
Draper, the son of John William Draper, recorded the first spectrogram of a star (Vega) to 
show absorption lines.</br>
Henry Draper's 1880 photograph of the Orion Nebula, the first ever 
taken.</br>
One of Andrew Ainslie Common's 1883 photographs of the same nebula, the 
first to show that a long exposure could record stars and nebulae invisible to the human 
eye.</br>
Astronomical photography did not become a serious research tool until the 
late 19th century, with the introduction of dry plate photography. It was first used by 
Sir William Huggins and his wife Margaret Lindsay Huggins, in 1876, in their work to 
record the spectra of astronomical objects. In 1880 Henry Draper used the new dry plate 
process with photographically corrected 11 in (28 cm) refracting telescope made by Alvan 
Clark to make a 51-minute exposure of the Orion Nebula, the first photograph of a nebula 
ever made. A breakthrough in astronomical photography came in 1883, when amateur 
astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the dry plate process to record several images of 
the same nebula in exposures up to 60 minutes with a 36 in (91 cm) reflecting telescope 
that he constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing, outside London. These images 
for the first time showed stars too faint to be seen by the human eye.<br>
The first all-sky photographic astrometry project, Astrographic Catalogue 
and Carte du Ciel, was started in 1887. It was conducted by 20 observatories all using 
special photographic telescopes with a uniform design called normal astrographs, all with 
an aperture of around 13 in (330 mm) and a focal length of 11 ft (3.4 m), designed to 
create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 
arcsecs/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. The attempt was to accurately map the 
sky down to the 14th magnitude but it was never completed.</br>
The beginning of the 20th century saw the worldwide construction of 
refracting telescopes and sophisticated large reflecting telescopes specifically designed 
for photographic imaging. Towards the middle of the century, giant telescopes such as the 
200 in (5.1 m) Hale Telescope and the 48 in (120 cm) Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar 
Observatory were pushing the limits of film photography.</br>
Some progress was made in the field of photographic emulsions and in the 
techniques of forming gas hypersensitization, cryogenic cooling, and light amplification, 
but starting in the 1970s after the invention of the CCD, photographic plates were 
gradually replaced by electronic imaging in professional and amateur observatories. CCD's 
are far more light sensitive, do not drop off in sensitivity over long exposures the way 
film does ("reciprocity failure"), have the ability to record in a much wider spectral 
range, and simplify storage of information. Telescopes now use many configurations of CCD 
sensors including linear arrays and large mosaics of CCD elements equivalent to 100 
million pixels, designed to cover the focal plane of telescopes that formerly used 10–14-
inch (25–36 cm) photographic plates.</br>
The Hubble Space Telescope shortly after the STS-125 maintenance mission 
in 2009.</br>
The late 20th century saw advances in astronomical imaging take place in 
the form of new hardware, with the construction of giant multi-mirror and segmented mirror 
telescopes. It would also see the introduction of space-based telescopes, such as the 
Hubble Space Telescope. Operating outside the atmosphere's turbulence, scattered ambient 
light and the vagaries of weather allows the Hubble Space Telescope, with a mirror 
diameter of 2.4 metres (94 in), to record stars down to the 30th magnitude, some 100 times 
dimmer than what the 5-meter Mount Palomar Hale telescope could record in 1949.</br></p>

Astrophotography is a hobby rapidly gaining popularity thanks to the 
fast advancing CMOS sensor technology. Over a decade ago, the light recording material 
employed in astrophotography was primarily chemical emulsion. Its low sensitivity makes it 
very hard to record the weak signal from deep space. In addition, the lack of real-time 
feedback is a huge source of frustration for beginners. Operational errors such as out-offocus can only be realized after several nights of hard work after the film is developed. 
In the mid 90s, the advent of cooled CCD cameras provided solutions to both the 
sensitivity and real-time feedback problems. However, their high prices and miserably 
small sensor areas limited their uses to only a few kinds of astrophotography and to very 
enthusiastic astrophotographers. While CCDs revolutionized astronomical research, this 
technology has never really changed the landscape of amateur astrophotography. The true 
turning point took place in 2002. After Fujifilm announced its FinePix S2Pro DSLR and 
showcased amazing astronomical pictures taken by this camera, people started to seriously 
explore DSLRs for astrophotography. DSLRs can provide real-time feedback, which is very 
important for beginners. They have sensitivities not much worse than CCDs, and DSLRs with 
large sensors (APS-C) are quite affordable nowadays. Today’s landscape in astrophotography 
is shaped by a series of CMOS-based DSLRs from Canon, but DSLRs and mirrorless cameras 
based on Sony sensors are gaining popularity very quickly.</br>.Because of my job, I have 
opportunities to use a broad range of imaging instruments, from multi-million dollar CCD 
cameras on large professional telescopes to amateur CCD cameras and DSLRs. My training in 
astronomical research also provides me toolsets to quantitatively evaluate the performance 
of sensors and to know their true limits. This helps not only my research, but also my 
lifetime hobby, astrophotography. On the hobby side, I mostly use DSLRs (Canon 5D Mark II 
and Nikon D800) for their high performance and affordable prices. To get the best 
astrophoto results, the DSLRs’ internal filters are modified to have higher throughput in 
the deep red, so they can be more efficient in recording the red light from ionized 
hydrogen gas in the universe. Other than this filter modification, DSLRs used for 
astrophotography are no different from DSLRs we use daily.</br>.One very common worry 
about using DSLRs on astrophoto is the thermal noise generated by the sensors. CCD cameras 
cooled to -20 or even -40 degrees C do not have such problems. However, CMOS sensors 
produced in recent five years all have very low thermal noise. Under the same sensor 
temperature, their thermal noise is actually much lower than common CCDs in astronomical 
cameras. Another important factor that many people overlook is noise sources other than 
heat in the sensor, one of which is the photon noise generated by the sky itself. With 
latest DLSRs under many circumstances, the sky photon noise often overwhelms the thermal 
noise, making cooling unnecessary. Only in places that are both hot and dark (such as the 
deserts in the south-west US), cooling is needed to fully exploit the dark sky.</br>

<strong> Can you capture with your camera?</br></strong>
The type of objects and the overall appearance of your final astro 
image will depend on which type of camera you choose.</br>

<strong>Targets for astrophotography beginners</strong>
<img ></br>
The Andromeda Galaxy by Nishant Revur, Washington, USA, 19 June 
2020.Three popular targets for beginners are the Perseus Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 
884), the Orion Nebula (M42) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).</br>For in-depth guides on 
imaging the latter two, read our tutorials on how to photograph the Orion Nebula and how 
to photograph the Andromeda Galaxy.</br>The all-in-one portable star trackers don’t have 
built-in autoguiding software, though you can add an autoguider to any EQ3 
mount.</br>“It’s not so important because most people go for objects they know to begin 
with, that they can find themselves,” says Trow.<br>The Orion Nebula by Derek Foster, 
Sheffield, UK, 18 November 2019.</br>The easiest way to get great results without spending 
hours processing images is to take one, long-exposure photograph of your object of choice. 
Experiment with shutter speeds up to about 90 seconds.</br>“With a 600mm lens, 90 seconds 
is as long as you’ll get before stars start to trail, but that’s more than enough for most 
deep-sky objects, particularly since newer cameras can bump up ISO,” says Trow.<br>Use a 
variety of settings – including different levels of white balance – and you’ll soon learn 
what works best for different lenses and targets.<br>
</ul> <h3>
10 simple astrophotography tips for beginners</br></h3>
<ol>
<strong>Switch to manual:</strong>
Switching your camera to M mode will give you full control over your 
camera’s settings.</br>
<strong>Pick a good location:</strong>
Find a good spot from which to take your astrophoto. Choose a dark 
spot away from light pollution where you stand a good chance of seeing a starry night sky. 
If this is not possible, make the best of what you've got: turn off all lights and use 
objects to shield your camera from streetlights.</br>
<strong>Check your camera's exposure:</strong>
A slow camera shutter speed of around 20 seconds allows plenty of 
starlight to be collected for astrophotography. For speeds slower than 30 seconds switch 
to the B (Bulb) function and use a cable release.</br>
<strong>Check your ISO:</strong>
The ISO controls the sensitivity. Higher ISOs are more sensitive, 
revealing more stars in your astrophoto but at the expense of picture quality, giving you 
a more grainy image.</br>
<strong>Watch out for noise:</strong>
Switch on noise reduction in your camera, which can be found in the 
menu, to improve image quality.<br>
<strong>Pick a suitable lens:</strong>
Use a wide-angle lens to start with and you’ll capture a surprising 
array of objects like planets, star clusters, dust lanes and nebulae.<br>
<strong>Control your aperture (f-number):</strong>
The iris controls the amount of light that passes through the camera 
lens. The lower the f-number, the more dilated the iris is, meaning more light enters your 
camer </br> Aim for f/4 or lower if your lens allows it </br>
<strong>Focus:</strong>
Because it’s dark focusing is often a case of trial and error. Switch 
to manual focus and set it to infinity. Take a test shot and slowly adjust the focus ring 
until your image is sharp </br>
<strong>Keep your camera steady:<strong>
The slightest movement has a significant effect on an astrophoto. A 
steady tripod and cable release help alleviate movement caused by wind or your finger 
clicking off a shot </br>
<strong>Pay attention to composure:<strong>
Use the rule of thirds to compose your image. Add something in the 
foreground to provide impact and perspective </br>
